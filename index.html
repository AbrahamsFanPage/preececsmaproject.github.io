            <h1> About Pet Rabbits </h1>
            <p>
                Rabbits are very social animals and make great pets! 
                However, it is important to take care of rabbits
                properly; if you are thinking about adopting, please
                make sure that you have adequate space inside of your 
                house for a rabbit companion. Keeping rabbits outside is
                dangerous due to predators, possible exposure to diseases,
                and heat. Pet bunnies should live inside with plenty
                of air conditioning!
            </p>

            <h1> Bunny Diets </h1>
            <p>
                A rabbit's diet should be mostly hay. Young rabbits
                should eat nutrient-filled alfalfa hay, while adult
                rabbits should eat timothy hay or oat hay. While cartoons show
                bunnies eating carrots, carrots should only be given
                as treats! Other suitable treats include strawberries,
                bananas, and blueberries. Please check online if food
                is safe for your rabbit before giving it to them.
            </p>

            <h1> One Bunny or Two? </h1>
            <p>
                Rabbits are very social, and they live in large
                groups in the wild. This means that domesticated 
                rabbits are typically happiest when living with
                a friend. However, if you are looking for a second
                bunny, please keep in mind that rabbits are also
                territorial, so they should be introduced to each other 
                slowly.
